Recent graduate of [Makers](https://makers.tech/), I'm a **full-stack Software Engineer** with a love for elegant and innovative products. An undergraduate in Chemical engineering and a Masters in Quantum encryption and it's business implications, and a wide unconventional job history. Leading me to the path of coding that has allowed me to hone skills I need to turn curiosity and creativity into a disciplined, deliberate process for building Software. I am product focused individual with ambitions to use Big Data and upcoming technology for long term practical applications.
 
# Background

Graduating from University in 2018, I moved to London in search for a job within the environment of tech. After winning the University of Leeds Business competition and always looking to improve processes, I was placed in a start ups business development role. Due to the complexity of the start up, I utilised my problem solving background in helping improving their dataset algorithm by an overall 11%. This is turn was a catalyst in taking my skill further - beginning my initial journey in the exciting field of software development.
